## UX (User Experience) ##

### Project Goals ### 

The goal for this project is to highlight the importance of self-sustaining ways of living or ways of living which allow people to occasionally escape city lives and reconnect with the natural world.

### User Goals ###

* To find information about the origin of dachas and similar concepts taken from other cultures.
* To view an array of dacha images which would spark curiosity and allow to envision personal goals.
* To learn the value of being closer to nature by way of lifestyle.
* Join a community of like-minded people to share personal experiences and promote holistic values.

### User Stories ###

### Site Owner Goals ###

* As a **site owner**, I want to outline what a dacha is and it's purpose.
* As a **site owner**, I want to inspire users to consider a wholesome lifestyle for themselves and wider community.
* As a **site owner**, I want to be able to connect with users if they wish to share ideas for the website or give feedback about their experience as a visitor or community member.

### User Requirements and Expectations ###

![Color Scheme](css/wireframes/earthy-autumn.png) 

I used [Coolors]("https://coolors.co/") colour palette to create the colour scheme you see here.

## Wireframing ##
---
I used [Balsamiq](https://) to create wireframes. This produced simple wireframes which I used to get an idea of which layouts would work better on different size screens.

See below for wireframes specific to device:

*   [Mobile Wireframe]("/")
*   [Tablet Wireframe]("/")
*   [Desktop Wireframe]("/")

Soon after I created wireframes for this website on paper, I realised that my target audience would not favour having to navigate across multiple pages, therefore, I switched to a landingpage design instead and with sections rather than pages.
